================

Using latest cygwin (setup.exe version 2.57, but packages vary).

Use this to configure:
  ./configure --enable-debug --enable-depend \
  --with-tcl-lib="-ltcl80" \
  --with-tk-lib="-ltk80" \
  --with-gl-lib="-lopengl32"

  ln -s x11includeslocation-fullpath /usr/include/X11
as /usr/include/tk.h tries to include X11/Xlib.h, and it looks like
X11 includes are not provided with cygwin any more (thus breaking
their installation of Tk).  Keeping a copy of the X11 includes in
Windows/cygwinX11.tar.gz just in case.  I got the X11 includes from an
earlier version of cygwin.

  ln -s tkPlatDecls.hlocation /usr/include/
as cygwin doesn't seem to include this header, we can't find
Tk_GetHWND.  Keeping a copy in Windows/tkPlatDecls.h just in case.  I
got this file from the Scriptics Tcl/Tk Windows distribution (which is
designed to be used with the Microsoft compiler presently :<).

Hints on using cygwin:

Had to add these lines to C:\CYGWIN\CYGWIN.BAT:
REM added by Ash to get the pipe symbol working
keyb us,,c:\windows\COMMAND\keyboard.sys
... this doesn't work on Windows ME, so had to set the keyboard to US
globally (grrr)

Can use cygcheck [filename] to give ldd-like functionality (ie
show the the dynamic libraries that an executable will use).

gdb --nw to avoid the annoying windowing interface
