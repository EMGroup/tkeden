By Ben Wyatt: ben@wyatt100.freeserve.co.uk

Note: this is a cut-down (by Ashley Ward) version of GLpng to fit it neatly
into the Eden distribution.  The original, with more documentation and
examples etc can be downloaded from

This is a library for OpenGL to load PNG graphics files as an OpenGL
texture as easily as possible. It also has a number of options for
generating the alpha channel and mipmaps. It is implemented using modified
versions of the LibPNG 1.0.2 and ZLib 1.1.3 libraries.
