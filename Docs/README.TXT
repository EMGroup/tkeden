EDEN VARIANTS

This source code can currently build three variants of Eden: tkeden
(this has a graphical user interface provided by Tcl/Tk, hence the
name, and is the variant most people usually use), dtkeden (tkeden
plus some distributed features which are only of use if you intend to
run multiple communicating tkedens) and ttyeden (a version with only a
command line interface which provides only the Eden notation).


NOTATIONS

tkeden and dtkeden provide multiple notations.  Eden is a definitive
notation with a C-like syntax, which is used to implement the other,
more domain-specific notations.  Donald is a definitive notation for
line drawing.  Scout is a definitive notation for window layout.
Sasami is a definitive notation for 3D graphics (which currently only
works under Windows).  LSD is a notation for specifying access to Eden
observables in dtkeden.
